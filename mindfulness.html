        <p>According to Jon Kabat-Zinn, mindfulness is ‘paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment and non judgementally’.
        <p>A simple theory that is often difficult for us to develop into a practice, and that is exactly what mindfulness is – a practice.  We practice the cultivation of awareness, of being non judgemental towards our thinking and ourselves. We practice waking up to experiences as they take place, moving our mind away from the past and future where they seem most comfortable, and into the present.</p>
        <p>Through being mindful we are less likely to miss out on all that we have and all that we experience. We are more practiced in tuning into the here and now and valuing the little things in life.</p>
        <p>The benefits are far reaching and will be experienced differently by each individual that invests in this practice. Just some of the benefits boasted by mindfulness practitioner and researchers are:</p>
        <ul class="highlight">
          <li>Mindfulness helps us manage difficult emotions and experiences more effectively, allowing us to feel skilled enough to turn towards them rather than hiding from them.</li>
          <li>Mindfulness encourages us to step out of autopilot, teaching us how to tune into experiences as they happen and therefore getting the most out of things as they happen.</li>
          <li>By focusing on the here and now, we are less likely to become caught up in the patterns of stress, worry and anxiety.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>PK Wellbeing provides an interactive and engaging array of courses that demonstrate how the brain works and teach us the skills needed to master our powerful minds.</p>

        <p>I am proud to be able to take such well designed curricula to people of all ages.</p>

          <p>This curriculum has been designed for primary school groups, ages 7-11, and it is delivered over six sessions lasting 60 minutes each or 12 sessions lasting 30 minutes each.</p>
          <p>The core of this course is to teach children about how their brains work and how they can develop skills to help manage how they feel. Paws B helps to boost wellbeing and gives students a greater sense of self, making them more resilient and resourceful. Students learn skills that will last a life time using and then do this through fun and curiosity.</p>

          <p>This curriculum is designed for secondary school students, ages 11-18, and provides an introduction to mindfulness that can be delivered to whole class groups or smaller, target groups.</p>
          <p>The interactive sessions can be carried out over 8-10 weeks, they engage students early on and help them to understand how their mind can be managed, enabling them to exercise more control over their feelings and actions.</p>
          <p>Each session has a different focus and teaches students a new skill. The course promotes wellbeing and helps students train their attention and concentration, which can ultimately have a positive impact on their academic achievement.</p>

          <p>This is an adult course designed specifically for adults working in schools, however it also works very well for parents. This eight-week course has a similar structure to the other eight-week, face-to-face courses like the MBSR or MBCT, however it has been designed with busy school life in mind so the demand on time is more manageable.</p>
          <p>Each session is 90 minutes and the participant is taught new skills to help manage stress and improve their quality of life.</p>
          <p>Learning in the adult course mirrors much of that done in the student groups so they work well together, making it an advantage for students, school staff and parents to take the course.</p>
          <p>This will help support the growth of mindfulness in home and school environments.</p>
