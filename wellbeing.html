        <p>Wellbeing can be interpreted and experienced in endless ways. It is something that is going to be generated differently by each of us, but ultimately it is a state of feeling ‘comfortable, healthy and happy’.</p>
        <p>On the surface this is a simple goal but there are hundreds of things in our daily lives that make our search for wellbeing an often-uphill battle. We have traffic, deadlines, demanding parents, bosses or teachers, less than inspiring weather, poor nutrition… The list goes on.  Our wellbeing is arguably the most valuable thing to us – or certainly should be – but in reality our personal wellbeing is often the first thing to slip away in the race to keep up with life.</p>
        <p>PK Wellbeing offers education and support to young people and adults, individually or within group settings. This education and support is centred on developing practical techniques and strategies for managing stress, anxiety and difficult times, as well as strategies to help us stop missing out on the good times. We can learn how to ‘tune-in’ to these and really value them – because they really are there. We just have to look more closely sometimes. Using secular mindfulness and resilience training to really appreciate what is going well and also acknowledging what isn’t feeling very comfortable can have a hugely beneficial impact on our overall wellbeing.</p>
        <p>We cannot control the external things that happen in the wider world, or even in our own lives, but we can choose how we respond to them and what we do with those events and experiences.</p>
        <p>Choosing well can make all the difference when it comes to our sense of satisfaction and happiness.</p>
