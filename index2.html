          <p>My name is Paula Kearney and I created PK Wellbeing in 2015. After taking the decision to move away from my career in teaching, I wanted to really focus on encouraging people to invest in their wellbeing: creating happier and more fulfilling lives day to day.</p>
          <p>I grew up as an anxious child, struggling to manage stress and being entirely unaware of how to cope with the feeling of being overwhelmed by things other people appeared to be dealing with without any issues at all. I did find some things that helped through my teens but nothing that provided any long term or reliable solutions.</p> <p>Whilst teaching at a school in Dublin, Ireland I was introduced to mindfulness. From there I developed my own personal practice and when I moved to different schools I realised just how much students needed some type of wellbeing practice in their lives to help manage the peaks of stress that they experience daily. Schools can be brilliant places but they can also be stressful hubs with very little silence or space. This led me to the decision to channel my energy towards equipping people in schools and businesses alike to build the skills they need to create this silence or space where it is not necessarily readily available.</p>
          <p>Today, the work I do with PK Wellbeing revolves around delivering mindfulness courses and working with organisations and individuals to create strategic plans to enhance wellbeing in schools and organisations. My goal is to help make wellbeing a priority while still remaining realistic about the consistently high levels of pressure and the need to be productive. A heightened sense of wellbeing will come in different packages for different people and it is my goal to help people on the road to finding out what that looks like.</p>
